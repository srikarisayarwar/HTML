    <h2>What is Recession?</h2>
    <p>A recession can be defined as a sustained period of weak or negative growth in real GDP (output) that is accompanied by a significant rise in the unemployment rate. Many other indicators of economic activity are also weak during a recession.</p>

    <h2><b>IT Market</b></h2><br>
    <p>Recession fears hit IT sector, Infosys, major players announce drastic cuts in pay hikes, promotions. The scenario is more or less the same with global players headquartered in the US and Europe that have a major presence in Bengaluru.Companies in various sectors, such as semiconductors, social media, and cloud computing, lowered their future projections, reported poor growth, and experienced a decrease in stock prices. By October, seven major tech companies, including Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, and Tesla, had lost over $3 trillion in combined market value. Google and Microsoft each lost around $700 billion, and Facebook, now Meta, lost $600 billion. The situation worsened further, with Amazon becoming the first public company, not just a tech business, to lose a trillion dollars in market value. Bloomberg reported on November 12 that Amazon's market value had dropped from $1.88 trillion to $879 billion, while Microsoft's market value also decreased to $889 billion.</p>

    <p>The IT sector has been estimated to have witnessed a growth of 40-45% of jobs in 2023 as compared to 2022. In 2024, hiring is further expected to surge by 15-20%. Owing to global recession and shift in business synergies, the Indian IT sector witnessed a dip during the initial quarters of this year.In the technology industry, the year 2022 was marked by major losses for the largest tech companies, as they saw trillions of dollars in market value disappear. This downturn was attributed to a variety of factors, including the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and rising inflation leading to increased interest rates, which all caused investor concerns.</p><br><br>
    <!-- <h2>CAUSES OF RECESSION</h2><br>
    <p>Businesses large and small face declines in sales and profits in a recession. Their efforts to cut costs may include layoffs and cuts in capital spending, marketing, and research.<b><ul>Recessions may curb credit access, slow collections, and spur business bankruptcies.</ul></b></p>
    <p>They may reduce hiring, impose a hiring freeze and suspend pay raises, resorting to layoffs to cut costs if all else fails. Companies may also cut capital spending and marketing, curtail research and development, and stop new product rollouts. Such cuts at large companies are likely to have ripple effects on their many employees and suppliers.</p>

 <h2>LAYOFFS</h2>
 <p>Technology companies across various industries have been laying off employees at a rapid rate, similar to the level seen during the Covid-19 pandemic's initial impact on the global economy in 2020. According to estimates, the struggling tech sector has cut over 150,000 jobs in 2022. This includes large companies such as Facebook parent company Meta Platforms (which announced over 11,000 layoffs in November) and Amazon (which may cut around 18,000 jobs), as well as smaller businesses in the US and other countries. The Indian IT services companies are major employers in the organized sector, and any global economic trends are likely to affect their growth projections. Indian start-up layoffs were also on the rise, with Inc42 reporting that over 15,700 employees were laid off in 2022 due to tightening funding conditions.</p>

 <h2><b>Historic recession: On India’s GDP slump</b></h2>
 <p>The fact that India’s economy entered a technical recession in the July-September period has now been confirmed by National Statistical Office data . Provisional estimates of gross domestic product for the second quarter of the year ending in March 2021 show economic output shrank by 7.5%, following the 23.9% contraction in the first quarter . Not only has the economy shrunk for a second successive quarter, marking a recession for the first time in independent India’s history, but the overall GDP figure of ₹33,14,167 crore (at 2011-12 prices) reveals output has slid back to the lowest level in 12 quarters. This one fact alone ought to give cause for serious concern, notwithstanding the apparent improvement in economic momentum that helped narrow the contraction from the preceding period’s precipitous fall. Even there, a closer look at both the expenditure side and the gross value added across various industry categories leaves little room for comfort. Private consumption expenditure — the single biggest component propelling GDP with a share exceeding 50% at constant prices and edging toward 60% in current prices — continued to shrink albeit at a slower pace (-11.3%), reflecting both consumer wariness to spend amid the pandemic and the impact of lost jobs and reduced incomes. And, government consumption spending that was hitherto a bulwark and what kept the bottom from falling out in the first quarter when it grew 16%, contracted by 22% revealing the precarious state of public finances. Taken together, demand was largely missing.</p><br>
